Three great ones of the city,\\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\\nOff-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,\\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance,\\nHorribly stuff’d with epithets of war:\\nAnd in conclusion,\\nNonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,\\n“I have already chose my officer.”\\nAnd what was he?\\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\\nA fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,\\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\\nNor the division of a battle knows\\nMore than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,\\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,\\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\\nChristian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d\\nBy debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,\\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhy, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,\\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\\nStood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself\\nWhether I in any just term am affin’d\\nTo love the Moor.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI would not follow him, then.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nO, sir, content you.\\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\\nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark\\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\\nWears out his time, much like his master’s ass,\\nFor nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.\\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\\nWho, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,\\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\\nDo well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,\\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,\\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\\nThe native act and figure of my heart\\nIn complement extern, ’tis not long after\\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,\\nIf he can carry’t thus!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nCall up her father,\\nRouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell,\\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\\nYet throw such changes of vexation on’t,\\nAs it may lose some color.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nHere is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\\nIs spied in populous cities.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat ho, Brabantio!

A street.\\n\\n Enter Roderigo and Iago.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nTush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly\\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,\\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\\n\\nIAGO.\\n’Sblood, but you will not hear me.\\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\\nAbhor me.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nThou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nDespise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\\nOff-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,\\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\\nEvades them, with a bombast circumstance,\\nHorribly stuff’d with epithets of war:\\nAnd in conclusion,\\nNonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,\\n“I have already chose my officer.”\\nAnd what was he?\\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\\nA fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,\\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\\nNor the division of a battle knows\\nMore than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,\\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\\nAs masterly as he: mere prattle without practice\\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,\\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,\\nChristian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d\\nBy debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,\\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhy, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,\\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\\nStood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself\\nWhether I in any just term am affin’d\\nTo love the Moor.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI would not follow him, then.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nO, sir, content you.\\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him:\\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\\nCannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark\\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\\nWears out his time, much like his master’s ass,\\nFor nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.\\nWhip me such honest knaves. Others there are\\nWho, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,\\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\\nAnd throwing but shows of service on their lords,\\nDo well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,\\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,\\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\\nWere I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\\nThe native act and figure of my heart\\nIn complement extern, ’tis not long after\\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\\nFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,\\nIf he can carry’t thus!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nCall up her father,\\nRouse him, make after him, poison his delight,\\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\\nAnd though he in a fertile climate dwell,\\nPlague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\\nYet throw such changes of vexation on’t,\\nAs it may lose some color.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nHere is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\\nIs spied in populous cities.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat ho, Brabantio!

Venice. Another street.\\n\\n Enter Othello, Iago and Attendants with torches.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\\nYet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience\\nTo do no contriv’d murder; I lack iniquity\\nSometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\\nI had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\n’Tis better as it is.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nNay, but he prated,\\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\\nAgainst your honour,\\nThat with the little godliness I have,\\nI did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,\\nAre you fast married? Be assur’d of this,\\nThat the magnifico is much belov’d\\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\\nAs double as the duke’s; he will divorce you,\\nOr put upon you what restraint and grievance\\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\\nWill give him cable.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nLet him do his spite;\\nMy services, which I have done the signiory,\\nShall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know,—\\nWhich, when I know that boasting is an honour,\\nI shall promulgate,—I fetch my life and being\\nFrom men of royal siege. And my demerits\\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\\nAs this that I have reach’d. For know, Iago,\\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\\nI would not my unhoused free condition\\nPut into circumscription and confine\\nFor the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nThose are the raised father and his friends:\\nYou were best go in.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nNot I; I must be found.\\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nBy Janus, I think no.\\n\\n Enter Cassio and Officers with torches.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nThe servants of the duke and my lieutenant.\\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends!\\nWhat is the news?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nThe duke does greet you, general,\\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance\\nEven on the instant.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nWhat is the matter, think you?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nSomething from Cyprus, as I may divine.\\nIt is a business of some heat. The galleys\\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\\nThis very night at one another’s heels;\\nAnd many of the consuls, rais’d and met,\\nAre at the duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for,\\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\\nThe senate hath sent about three several quests\\nTo search you out.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\n’Tis well I am found by you.\\nI will but spend a word here in the house,\\nAnd go with you.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nAncient, what makes he here?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:\\nIf it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI do not understand.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nHe’s married.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nTo who?\\n\\n Enter Othello.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nMarry to—Come, captain, will you go?\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nHave with you.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\\n\\n Enter Brabantio, Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advis’d,\\nHe comes to bad intent.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nHolla, stand there!\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nSignior, it is the Moor.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nDown with him, thief!\\n\\n [_They draw on both sides._]\\n\\nIAGO.\\nYou, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.\\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\\nThan with your weapons.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?\\nDamn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,\\nFor I’ll refer me to all things of sense,\\n(If she in chains of magic were not bound)\\nWhether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,\\nSo opposite to marriage, that she shunn’d\\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\\nWould ever have, to incur a general mock,\\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\\nOf such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight.\\nJudge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,\\nThat thou hast practis’d on her with foul charms,\\nAbus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\\nThat weakens motion. I’ll have’t disputed on;\\n’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\\nFor an abuser of the world, a practiser\\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.—\\nLay hold upon him, if he do resist,\\nSubdue him at his peril.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nHold your hands,\\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest:\\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\\nWithout a prompter. Where will you that I go\\nTo answer this your charge?\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nTo prison, till fit time\\nOf law and course of direct session\\nCall thee to answer.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nWhat if I do obey?\\nHow may the duke be therewith satisfied,\\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\\nUpon some present business of the state,\\nTo bring me to him?\\n\\nOFFICER.\\n’Tis true, most worthy signior,\\nThe duke’s in council, and your noble self,\\nI am sure is sent for.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nHow? The duke in council?\\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\\nMine’s not an idle cause. The duke himself,\\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\\nCannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.\\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\\nBond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE III. Venice. A council chamber.\\n\\n The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nThere is no composition in these news\\nThat gives them credit.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nIndeed, they are disproportion’d;\\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nAnd mine a hundred and forty.\\n\\nSECOND SENATOR\\nAnd mine two hundred:\\nBut though they jump not on a just account,\\n(As in these cases, where the aim reports,\\n’Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm\\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nNay, it is possible enough to judgement:\\nI do not so secure me in the error,\\nBut the main article I do approve\\nIn fearful sense.\\n\\nSAILOR.\\n[_Within._] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!\\n\\nOFFICER.\\nA messenger from the galleys.\\n\\n Enter Sailor.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nNow,—what’s the business?\\n\\nSAILOR.\\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,\\nSo was I bid report here to the state\\nBy Signior Angelo.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nHow say you by this change?\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nThis cannot be\\nBy no assay of reason. ’Tis a pageant\\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\\nThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;\\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\\nBut altogether lacks the abilities\\nThat Rhodes is dress’d in. If we make thought of this,\\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskilful\\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nNay, in all confidence, he’s not for Rhodes.\\n\\nOFFICER.\\nHere is more news.\\n\\n Enter a Messenger.\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\\n\\nMESSENGER.\\nOf thirty sail, and now they do re-stem\\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\\nAnd prays you to believe him.\\n\\nDUKE.\\n’Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nHe’s now in Florence.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\\n\\n Enter Brabantio, Othello, Iago, Roderigo and Officers.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\\n[_To Brabantio._] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,\\nWe lack’d your counsel and your help tonight.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.\\nNeither my place, nor aught I heard of business\\nHath rais’d me from my bed, nor doth the general care\\nTake hold on me; for my particular grief\\nIs of so flood-gate and o’erbearing nature\\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows,\\nAnd it is still itself.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nWhy, what’s the matter?\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\\n\\nDUKE and SENATORS.\\nDead?\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nAy, to me.\\nShe is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted\\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\\nFor nature so preposterously to err,\\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\\nSans witchcraft could not.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nWhoe’er he be, that in this foul proceeding,\\nHath thus beguil’d your daughter of herself,\\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\\nStood in your action.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nHumbly I thank your grace.\\nHere is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems\\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\\nHath hither brought.\\n\\nALL.\\nWe are very sorry for ’t.\\n\\nDUKE.\\n[_To Othello._] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nNothing, but this is so.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\\nMy very noble and approv’d good masters:\\nThat I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,\\nIt is most true; true, I have married her.\\nThe very head and front of my offending\\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\\nAnd little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;\\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,\\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d\\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\\nAnd little of this great world can I speak,\\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\\nI will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver\\nOf my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,\\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic,\\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\\nI won his daughter.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nA maiden never bold:\\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\\nBlush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\\nTo fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!\\nIt is judgement maim’d and most imperfect\\nThat will confess perfection so could err\\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\\nTo find out practices of cunning hell,\\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again,\\nThat with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,\\nOr with some dram conjur’d to this effect,\\nHe wrought upon her.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nTo vouch this is no proof;\\nWithout more wider and more overt test\\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nBut, Othello, speak:\\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\\nSubdue and poison this young maid’s affections?\\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nI do beseech you,\\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary,\\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\\nEven fall upon my life.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nFetch Desdemona hither.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nAncient, conduct them, you best know the place.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._]\\n\\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\\nSo justly to your grave ears I’ll present\\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,\\nAnd she in mine.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nSay it, Othello.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nHer father lov’d me, oft invited me,\\nStill question’d me the story of my life,\\nFrom year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,\\nThat I have pass’d.\\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\\nTo the very moment that he bade me tell it,\\nWherein I spake of most disastrous chances,\\nOf moving accidents by flood and field;\\nOf hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;\\nOf being taken by the insolent foe,\\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\\nAnd portance in my traveler’s history,\\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,\\nIt was my hint to speak,—such was the process;\\nAnd of the Cannibals that each other eat,\\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear\\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch,\\nShe’d come again, and with a greedy ear\\nDevour up my discourse; which I observing,\\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears,\\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\\nThat my youth suffer’d. My story being done,\\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\\nShe swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;\\n’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.\\nShe wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d\\nThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,\\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,\\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\\nShe lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,\\nAnd I lov’d her that she did pity them.\\nThis only is the witchcraft I have us’d.\\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\\n\\n Enter  Desdemona, Iago and Attendants.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nI think this tale would win my daughter too.\\nGood Brabantio,\\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\\nThan their bare hands.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nI pray you hear her speak.\\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\\nLight on the man!—Come hither, gentle mistress:\\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\\nWhere most you owe obedience?\\n\\nDESDEMONA.\\nMy noble father,\\nI do perceive here a divided duty:\\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\\nMy life and education both do learn me\\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty,\\nI am hitherto your daughter: but here’s my husband.\\nAnd so much duty as my mother show’d\\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\\nDue to the Moor my lord.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nGod be with you! I have done.\\nPlease it your grace, on to the state affairs.\\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.—\\nCome hither, Moor:\\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\\nI would keep from thee.—For your sake, jewel,\\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\\nTo hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nLet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,\\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\\nInto your favour.\\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\\nPatience her injury a mockery makes.\\nThe robb’d that smiles steals something from the thief;\\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile;\\nHe bears the sentence well, that nothing bears\\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal:\\nBut words are words; I never yet did hear\\nThat the bruis’d heart was pierced through the ear.\\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the\\nfortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a\\nsubstitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign\\nmistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must\\ntherefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with\\nthis more stubborn and boisterous expedition.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\\nMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize\\nA natural and prompt alacrity\\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\\nWith such accommodation and besort\\nAs levels with her breeding.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nIf you please,\\nBe’t at her father’s.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nI’ll not have it so.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nNor I.\\n\\nDESDEMONA.\\nNor I. I would not there reside,\\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts,\\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,\\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\\nT’ assist my simpleness.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nWhat would you, Desdemona?\\n\\nDESDEMONA.\\nThat I did love the Moor to live with him,\\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\\nMay trumpet to the world: my heart’s subdued\\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\\nI saw Othello’s visage in his mind,\\nAnd to his honours and his valiant parts\\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\\nThe rites for which I love him are bereft me,\\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nLet her have your voice.\\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\\nNor to comply with heat, the young affects\\nIn me defunct, and proper satisfaction,\\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\\nI will your serious and great business scant\\nFor she is with me. No, when light-wing’d toys\\nOf feather’d Cupid seel with wanton dullness\\nMy speculative and offic’d instruments,\\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\\nAnd all indign and base adversities\\nMake head against my estimation.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\\nEither for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,\\nAnd speed must answer it.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nYou must away tonight.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nWith all my heart.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nAt nine i’ the morning here we’ll meet again.\\nOthello, leave some officer behind,\\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\\nWith such things else of quality and respect\\nAs doth import you.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nSo please your grace, my ancient,\\nA man he is of honesty and trust,\\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\\nWith what else needful your good grace shall think\\nTo be sent after me.\\n\\nDUKE.\\nLet it be so.\\nGood night to everyone. [_To Brabantio._] And, noble signior,\\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\\n\\nFIRST SENATOR.\\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\\n\\nBRABANTIO.\\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:\\nShe has deceiv’d her father, and may thee.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &amp;c._]\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,\\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\\nI prithee, let thy wife attend on her,\\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.—\\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction,\\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona._]\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nIago—\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhat sayst thou, noble heart?\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat will I do, thinkest thou?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhy, go to bed and sleep.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI will incontinently drown myself.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nIt is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a\\nprescription to die when death is our physician.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nO villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years,\\nand since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never\\nfound man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown\\nmyself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a\\nbaboon.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not\\nin my virtue to amend it.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nVirtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies\\nare gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will\\nplant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it\\nwith one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it\\nsterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and\\ncorrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our\\nlives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the\\nblood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous\\nconclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal\\nstings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you call love, to\\nbe a sect, or scion.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nIt cannot be.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be\\na man. Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me\\nthy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of\\nperdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put\\nmoney in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an\\nusurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that\\nDesdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy\\npurse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt\\nsee an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors\\nare changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that\\nto him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb\\nas the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with\\nhis body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change,\\nshe must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn\\nthyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\\nthou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian\\nand a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the\\ntribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\\ndrowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be\\nhanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nThou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I\\nretell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted;\\nthine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against\\nhim: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a\\nsport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be\\ndelivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this\\ntomorrow. Adieu.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhere shall we meet i’ the morning?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAt my lodging.\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI’ll be with thee betimes.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nGo to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nWhat say you?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nNo more of drowning, do you hear?\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI am changed. I’ll sell all my land.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nIAGO.\\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\\nFor I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane\\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\\nAnd it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets\\nHe has done my office. I know not if ’t be true,\\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well,\\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\\nCassio’s a proper man. Let me see now,\\nTo get his place, and to plume up my will\\nIn double knavery. How, how? Let’s see.\\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello’s ear\\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose,\\nTo be suspected, fram’d to make women false.\\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\\nAnd will as tenderly be led by the nose\\nAs asses are.\\nI have’t. It is engender’d. Hell and night\\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Tomorrow with your earliest\\nLet me have speech with you. [_To Desdemona._] Come, my dear love,\\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\\nThat profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.—\\nGood night.\\n\\n [_Exeunt Othello, Desdemona and Attendants._]\\n\\n Enter Iago.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nWelcome, Iago. We must to the watch.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nNot this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’ clock. Our general\\ncast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not\\ntherefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and\\nshe is sport for Jove.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nShe’s a most exquisite lady.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAnd, I’ll warrant her, full of game.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nIndeed, she is a most fresh and delicate creature.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nAn inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarm to love?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nShe is indeed perfection.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of\\nwine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain\\nhave a measure to the health of black Othello.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nNot tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for\\ndrinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of\\nentertainment.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nO, they are our friends; but one cup: I’ll drink for you.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too,\\nand behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the\\ninfirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhat, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nWhere are they?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nHere at the door. I pray you, call them in.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI’ll do’t; but it dislikes me.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,\\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\\nHe’ll be as full of quarrel and offence\\nAs my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo,\\nWhom love hath turn’d almost the wrong side out,\\nTo Desdemona hath tonight carous’d\\nPotations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch:\\nThree lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\\nThat hold their honours in a wary distance,\\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\\nHave I tonight fluster’d with flowing cups,\\nAnd they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards,\\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\\nThat may offend the isle. But here they come:\\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\\nMy boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.\\n\\n Enter Cassio, Montano and Gentlemen; followed by Servant with wine.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\n’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.\\n\\nMONTANO.\\nGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nSome wine, ho!\\n[_Sings._]\\n\\n    _And let me the cannikin clink, clink,\\n    And let me the cannikin clink, clink:\\n        A soldier’s a man,\\n        O, man’s life’s but a span,\\n    Why then let a soldier drink._\\n\\nSome wine, boys!\\n\\nCASSIO.\\n’Fore God, an excellent song.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nI learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting:\\nyour Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander,—drink, ho!—are\\nnothing to your English.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not\\nto overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next\\npottle can be filled.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nTo the health of our general!\\n\\nMONTANO.\\nI am for it, lieutenant; and I’ll do you justice.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nO sweet England!\\n\\n[_Sings._]\\n\\n    _King Stephen was a worthy peer,\\n        His breeches cost him but a crown;\\n    He held them sixpence all too dear,\\n        With that he call’d the tailor lown.\\n    He was a wight of high renown,\\n        And thou art but of low degree:\\n    ’Tis pride that pulls the country down,\\n        Then take thine auld cloak about thee._\\n\\nSome wine, ho!\\n\\nCASSIO.\\n’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWill you hear ’t again?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nNo, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things.\\nWell, God’s above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be\\nsouls must not be saved.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIt’s true, good lieutenant.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nFor mine own part, no offence to the general, nor any man of quality, I\\nhope to be saved.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAnd so do I too, lieutenant.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nAy, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved\\nbefore the ancient.

The general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nWhy, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?\\nAre we turn’d Turks, and to ourselves do that\\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:\\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\\nSilence that dreadful bell, it frights the isle\\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\\nSpeak, who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\\nIn quarter, and in terms like bride and groom\\nDevesting them for bed; and then, but now,\\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\\nSwords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,\\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\\nAny beginning to this peevish odds;\\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\\nThe world hath noted, and your name is great\\nIn mouths of wisest censure: what’s the matter,\\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\\n\\nMONTANO.\\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\\nYour officer, Iago, can inform you,\\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends me,\\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\\nBy me that’s said or done amiss this night,\\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\\nWhen violence assails us.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nNow, by heaven,\\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\\nAnd passion, having my best judgement collied,\\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on,\\nAnd he that is approv’d in this offence,\\nThough he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,\\nShall lose me. What! in a town of war,\\nYet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,\\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\\n’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?\\n\\nMONTANO.\\nIf partially affin’d, or leagu’d in office,\\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\\nThou art no soldier.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nTouch me not so near.\\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\\nThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio.\\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\\nMontano and myself being in speech,\\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\\nAnd Cassio following him with determin’d sword,\\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\\nLest by his clamour (as it so fell out)\\nThe town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\\nOutran my purpose: and I return’d the rather\\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\\nI ne’er might say before. When I came back,\\n(For this was brief) I found them close together,\\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\\nWhen you yourself did part them.\\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget;\\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d\\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity,\\nWhich patience could not pass.\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nI know, Iago,\\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\\nMaking it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,\\nBut never more be officer of mine.\\n\\n Enter Desdemona, attended.\\n\\nLook, if my gentle love be not rais’d up!\\nI’ll make thee an example.\\n\\nDESDEMONA.\\nWhat’s the matter?\\n\\nOTHELLO.\\nAll’s well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\\nSir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon.\\nLead him off.\\n\\n [_Montano is led off._]\\n\\nIago, look with care about the town,\\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\\nCome, Desdemona: ’tis the soldiers’ life\\nTo have their balmy slumbers wak’d with strife.\\n\\n [_Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio._]\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nAy, past all surgery.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nMarry, Heaven forbid!\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I\\nhave lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My\\nreputation, Iago, my reputation!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAs I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound;\\nthere is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle\\nand most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without\\ndeserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute\\nyourself such a loser. What, man, there are ways to recover the general\\nagain: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy\\nthan in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to\\naffright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he’s yours.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander\\nwith so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and\\nspeak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with\\none’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name\\nto be known by, let us call thee devil!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhat was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI know not.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nIs’t possible?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but\\nnothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths\\nto steal away their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel,\\nand applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nWhy, but you are now well\\n\\n enough: how came you thus recovered?\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath.\\nOne unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nCome, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the\\ncondition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not\\nbefallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!\\nHad I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To\\nbe now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O\\nstrange! Every inordinate cup is unbless’d, and the ingredient is a\\ndevil.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.\\nExclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I\\nlove you.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI have well approved it, sir.—I drunk!\\n\\nIAGO.\\nYou, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what\\nyou shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general; I may say so in\\nthis respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the\\ncontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess\\nyourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place\\nagain. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\\nshe holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is\\nrequested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to\\nsplinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of\\nyour love shall grow stronger than it was before.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nYou advise me well.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the\\nvirtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes\\nif they check me here.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\\n\\nCASSIO.\\nGood night, honest Iago.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\nIAGO.\\nAnd what’s he then, that says I play the villain?\\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\\nTo win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy\\nThe inclining Desdemona to subdue\\nIn any honest suit. She’s fram’d as fruitful\\nAs the free elements. And then for her\\nTo win the Moor, were’t to renounce his baptism,\\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\\nHis soul is so enfetter’d to her love\\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\\nWith his weak function. How am I then, a villain\\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\\nAs I do now: for whiles this honest fool\\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\\nI’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,\\nThat she repeals him for her body’s lust;\\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\\nThat shall enmesh them all.\\n\\n Enter Roderigo.\\n\\nHow now, Roderigo?\\n\\nRODERIGO.\\nI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one\\nthat fills up the cry. My money is almost spent, I have been tonight\\nexceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have\\nso much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a\\nlittle more wit, return again to Venice.\\n\\nIAGO.\\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\\nThou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,\\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\\nDoes’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio;\\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\\nContent thyself awhile. By the mass, ’tis morning;\\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\\nAway, I say, thou shalt know more hereafter.\\nNay, get thee gone.\\n\\n [_Exit Roderigo._]\\n\\nTwo things are to be done,\\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\\nI’ll set her on;\\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart,\\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way.\\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\\n\\n [_Exit._]\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
